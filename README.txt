The example data for the phylogenetic constrained multi-omic analysis includes the gene expression and gene body DNA methylation of TGFbeta gene family in asthmatics:

"asthmaticsNormal.csv" includes the means and variances of gene expression and gene body methylation in normal samples;

"asthmaticsPatient.csv" includes the means and variances of gene expression and gene body methylation in patient samples;

"tree.nj.nexus" provides the phylogenetic tree of the gene family. 

The script "toRun.R" performs the whole phylogenetic constrained multi-omic analysis using the up-mentioned three data files as input and the corresponding result files will be automatically generated in the same directory.
